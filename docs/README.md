Welcome to the documentation for **py_tmi**, a Python port of the [tmi.js](https://github.com/tmijs/tmi.js) Twitch Messaging Interface client. This guide explains the architecture, usage patterns, and API surface of the library so you can build robust Twitch chat clients and automations in Python.

- [Getting Started](getting-started.md) – installation, configuration, and a quick tutorial.
- [Architecture Overview](architecture.md) – design goals, core components, and how they map to the original project.
- [Client API Reference](api/client.md) – full detail on `Client` methods, events, and state helpers.
- [Utilities & Helpers](api/utilities.md) – reference for parsers, utilities, and data structures.
- [Contributing](contributing.md) – guidance for extending the library and working on the codebase.
